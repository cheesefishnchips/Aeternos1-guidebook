# Aeternos1-guidebook v1.2

Descriptions for Aeternos1 modpack minecraft

I formatted these for book format with patchouli but then i had issues uploading to server side as they are careful with security and uploading things. Let me know if anyone figures out lol. 

This version adds:
- Easy Emerald Toos, which adds tools and armour made from Emerald, ruby, and more

- Genshin Instruments, which adds playable music instruments from the game
  
- Randomore, an ore that drops a random item, apparently able to use silk touch 

- Small ships which adds some charming small ships
